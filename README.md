### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

To be honest, I cannot say if I have mastered anything, I have only acknowledged that I need to immerse myself religiously in the tech language for my survival.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Comments, Literals, Identifiers, and Reserved Words**: Understanding the Template literals and their features, rules and importance of identifiers, as well as the special meanings of reserved words, to be able to apply myself in code accordingly
- **Immutable Primitive Values and Mutable Object References**: Best practices for handling immutable data and object references.


#### Areas for Improvement

- **Debugging Basics in Javascript**: I want to better understand the process and importance of debugging in JavaScript, type checking and type conversions in JavaScript, as well as the basic debugging method and its suitability per bug.

#### Overall Learning Experience

This project was an invaluable hands-on experience in the basics or fundamentals of JavaScript. It assisted in giving insight as to my downfalls of understanding the tech language. I am glad to have that insight, as it has enlightened me to change my methods of learning and minimise my usage of AI tools for my knowledge and benefit.
